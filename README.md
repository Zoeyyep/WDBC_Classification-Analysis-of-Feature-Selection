# WDBC_Classification-Analysis-of-Feature-Selection
This study compares Random Forest, Logistic  Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural  Network (ANN), and XGBOOST on the Wisconsin Diagnostic  Breast Cancer (WDBC) dataset by calculating their classification  test accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. The dataset was divided  using a K-fold cross-check in the following way: four copies of  training data and one copy of test data for testing and all the  classifiers' parameters were assigned. Results show that the best  classifier was the Logistic Regression model with an average auc  value close to 1, followed by the Random Forest models, while  XGBOOST was the poorest model.
